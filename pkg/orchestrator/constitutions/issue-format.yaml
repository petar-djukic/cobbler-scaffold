# Issue Format Constitution
#
# Formal YAML schema for issue descriptions produced by the measure phase
# and consumed by the stitch phase. Referenced by the measure prompt (to
# tell Claude what format to produce) and used by stitch (to validate what
# it reads back).

schema:
  description: |
    Every issue description must be a valid YAML document conforming to this
    schema. The stitch agent parses the description as YAML to extract
    required_reading, files, requirements, and acceptance_criteria.

  required_fields:
    - deliverable_type
    - required_reading
    - files
    - requirements
    - acceptance_criteria

  optional_fields:
    - format_rule
    - required_sections
    - design_decisions

yaml_rules:
  - rule: All strings containing colons, commas, or special YAML characters must be quoted.
    example_bad: "- R1: Implement feature: core"
    example_good: '- "R1: Implement feature: core"'

  - rule: List items are YAML mappings, not bare strings, when they have sub-fields.
    example_bad: "- Use table accessor pattern"
    example_good: |
      - id: D1
        text: Use table accessor pattern

  - rule: Use ASCII dashes (--) not Unicode em dashes or en dashes.
    example_bad: "Flag interactions — especially combined flags"
    example_good: "Flag interactions -- especially combined flags"

  - rule: Design decision IDs use D1, D2, ... prefix as mapping keys.
    example_bad: "- Use singleton pattern"
    example_good: |
      - id: D1
        text: Use singleton pattern

  - rule: Requirement strings should be quoted when they contain colons.
    example_good: '- "R1: Implement ExampleType per prd001"'
