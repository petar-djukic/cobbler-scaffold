title: Metrics Collection and Reporting

problem: |
  Without visibility into what each Claude invocation produces, developers
  cannot assess the efficiency of the generation process. Token counts,
  lines of code changed, and git diff statistics are scattered across
  Claude output and git history. We need structured metrics collection
  that records per-invocation data and provides aggregate project statistics.

goals:
  - G1: Collect per-invocation metrics (tokens, LOC, diff stats) and store them on beads issues
  - G2: Provide aggregate project statistics (Go LOC, documentation word counts)
  - G3: Support LOC snapshots before and after each Claude invocation

requirements:
  R1:
    title: InvocationRecord
    items:
      - R1.1: InvocationRecord must include Caller (string) identifying "measure" or "stitch"
      - R1.2: InvocationRecord must include StartedAt (string, RFC3339) for the invocation timestamp
      - R1.3: InvocationRecord must include DurationS (int) for total duration in seconds
      - R1.4: InvocationRecord must include Tokens with Input and Output counts
      - R1.5: InvocationRecord must include LOCBefore with Production and Test counts
      - R1.6: InvocationRecord must include LOCAfter with Production and Test counts
      - R1.7: InvocationRecord must include Diff with Files, Insertions, and Deletions counts
      - R1.8: recordInvocation must serialize InvocationRecord to JSON and add it as a beads comment

  R2:
    title: LOC Snapshots
    items:
      - R2.1: captureLOC must return a LocSnapshot with Production and Test line counts
      - R2.2: LOC counting must use the configured GoSourceDirs
      - R2.3: Production LOC must exclude test files (*_test.go)
      - R2.4: Test LOC must count only test files (*_test.go)
      - R2.5: captureLOC must swallow errors (best-effort collection)

  R3:
    title: Stats Collection
    items:
      - R3.1: CollectStats must count Go production LOC across GoSourceDirs
      - R3.2: CollectStats must count Go test LOC across GoSourceDirs
      - R3.3: CollectStats must count documentation words using SpecGlobs patterns
      - R3.4: Stats must print results in a human-readable format

  R4:
    title: Token Parsing
    items:
      - R4.1: parseClaudeTokens must extract token usage from Claude stream-json output
      - R4.2: parseClaudeTokens must find the last JSON line with type "result"
      - R4.3: parseClaudeTokens must return zero values when no result line is found

  R5:
    title: Git Diff Statistics
    items:
      - R5.1: Git diff stats must be captured between pre-merge and post-merge HEAD
      - R5.2: Diff stats must include files changed, insertions, and deletions
      - R5.3: gitDiffShortstat must parse the output of git diff --shortstat

non_goals:
  - This PRD does not define dashboards or visualization of metrics
  - This PRD does not define historical trend analysis
  - This PRD does not define metrics export to external systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
  - This PRD does not define cost estimation from token counts

acceptance_criteria:
  - Every Claude invocation produces an InvocationRecord stored on the beads issue
  - LOC snapshots capture production and test counts before and after each invocation
  - Stats prints Go LOC and documentation word counts
  - Token parsing extracts input and output counts from Claude output
  - Diff stats capture files changed, insertions, and deletions per task
